                            G.L.O.W was born from a simple but powerful realization: the world of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, 
                            Arts, and Mathematics) has historically been a space where girls' voices are underrepresented, their potential 
                            overlooked, and their dreams dismissed. I've seen too many brilliant young women hesitate to pursue their passions 
                            in robotics, coding, engineering, or research because they didn't see themselves reflected in those fields—or 
                            because they were told, directly or indirectly, that these spaces weren't for them.
                        </p>
                        <p class="glow-text">
                            My own journey in STEAM has been shaped by incredible mentors who believed in me, challenged me, and showed me 
                            what's possible. But I also know how rare those mentors can be, especially for girls from underrepresented 
                            communities. G.L.O.W is my commitment to being that mentor, that advocate, that voice of encouragement for the 
                            next generation of girls who are curious, creative, and ready to change the world.

                            <strong>G.L.O.W is committed to bringing STEAM to girls</strong>—not as an afterthought, but as a core mission. 
                            We believe that every girl deserves access to hands-on learning experiences, mentorship from women who've walked 
                            similar paths, and a community where their ideas are valued and their questions are welcomed.

                            robotics, experiment with code, design solutions to real-world problems, and see themselves as innovators and 
                            leaders. We're not just teaching skills—we're building confidence, fostering curiosity, and creating pathways 
                            for girls to pursue their passions in STEAM fields.

                    <div class="mentorship-content">
                        <p class="glow-text">
                            There's something incredibly powerful about watching a girl's eyes light up when she successfully codes her first 
                            program, or when she realizes she can build something that solves a real problem. I love working with girls because 
                            they bring fresh perspectives, unapologetic creativity, and a determination that's often underestimated. They ask 
                            questions that challenge assumptions, they think in ways that break traditional molds, and they support each other 
                            in ways that create genuine community.
                        </p>
                        <p class="glow-text">
                            Being a mentor means more than just teaching—it means listening, encouraging, and sometimes just being present. 
                            I've had the privilege of working with girls who are building their first robots, writing their first lines of code, 
                            or presenting their first research projects. In those moments, I see not just their current work, but their future 
                            potential. I see future engineers, scientists, artists, and leaders who will shape the world in ways we can't yet 
                            imagine.
                        </p>
                        <p class="glow-text">
                            What I love most is creating spaces where girls can be authentically themselves—where they can be curious, make 
                            mistakes, ask "why" and "what if," and know that their voices matter. Mentorship, for me, is about paying forward 
                            the support I received and ensuring that the next generation of girls has even more opportunities, more role models, 
                            and more confidence to pursue their dreams in STEAM.
